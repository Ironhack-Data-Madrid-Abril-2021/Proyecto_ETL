# TL Project

  

  

## Introduction

  

On this project, we will develop a full ETL process, obtaining our information from at leats 3 resources including databases and APIs. Then, we will transform that data so we can analyze the data.

 
You can find 2 main archives on my repo:

  

- The TL Project_final.py Python file. Were you can find the clean code.

- De Playground.ipyb, a Jupyter notebook where you can see how data was cleaned and the checks where made in the process.
