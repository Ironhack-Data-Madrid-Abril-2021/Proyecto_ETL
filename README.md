# ETL project _ Pokémon First Generation

### Dataset obtained from:

		+ Kaggle (csv)
		+ Pokémon API
		+ Wikipedia (Web Scraping)

Dear reader,


The goal of this exercise is too collect information from different sources, and concatenate it into a Dataset which will be exported into SQL.


To achieve the above stated, I chose as topic the 1st generation Pokémon (151 counting with Mew).
The created Dataset reunites basic statistics of attack, defense and special attack, alongside with other notes for curiosity matters.

I've extracted a csv from Kaggle, added further information from Pokémon API, and finally completed with some Wikipedia information.


Enjoy the reading!


Best regards,


Francisco Freire
